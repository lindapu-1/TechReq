Overall Score: 4.1/5\\n\\n## 2. Breakdown:\\n- Specificity: 4.3/5\\n- Relevance: 4.5/5\\n- Non-Redundancy: 3.5/5\\n\\n## 3. Issues Found:\\n\\n### Specificity Issues:\\n- Some metrics lack standardized test conditions (e.g., \"Grip fatigue onset\" needs a defined grip force and task)\\n- \"Task versatility index\" and \"Survival abuse test\" need clearer definitions of the standardized tests\\n- \"Opening mechanism smoothness\" would benefit from a more specific measurement methodology\\n\\n### Relevance Issues:\\n- All categories are relevant, excellent coverage of engineering needs\\n\\n### Non-Redundancy Issues:\\n- Significant overlaps exist:\\n  - Edge retention appears in both culinary-focused and general blade metrics\\n  - Multiple lock strength metrics that measure similar properties (lock failure force, lock strength)\\n  - Redundant thickness measurements (thickness, folded thickness, closed profile thickness)\\n  - Several similar grip-related metrics that could be consolidated\\n  - Multiple corrosion resistance measurements across different categories\\n  - Deployment metrics appear in multiple categories with slight variations\\n\\nThe metrics are highly specific and relevant for engineering implementation, with most having clear units and measurement criteria. The main improvement opportunity is reducing redundancy where similar properties are measured across different functional categories.', type='TextMessage'), inner_messages=[])"
