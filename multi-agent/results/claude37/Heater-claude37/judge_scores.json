Overall Score: 3.8/5\\n\\n## 2. Breakdown:\\n- Specificity: 4.5/5\\n- Relevance: 4/5\\n- Non-Redundancy: 3/5\\n\\n## 3. Issues Found:\\n\\n**Specificity Issues:**\\n- \"Thermal insulation effectiveness\" uses W/(m\u00b2\u00b7K) which is correct, but might need standardized test conditions\\n- \"Fire retardancy of housing material per UL 94 standard\" appropriately references the standard\\n\\n**Relevance Issues:**\\n- Marketing-focused metrics appear in several categories:\\n  - \"Average customer rating\" and \"Net Promoter Score\" are marketing metrics, not engineering\\n  - \"Purchase price\" is financial rather than engineering\\n  - \"Positive customer reviews\" category is entirely marketing-focused\\n\\n**Non-Redundancy Issues:**\\n- Significant overlap between categories:\\n  - Multiple thermal cutoff metrics across different categories\\n  - \"Cool-touch surfaces\" appears twice with overlapping metrics\\n  - Safety certification metrics could be consolidated\\n  - Redundant thermal metrics:\\n    - \"Maximum external surface temperature\" and \"Heat deflection temperature\"\\n    - \"Thermal contact resistance\" and \"Thermal conductivity\" measure related properties\\n  - Smart technology sections have significant overlap between \"integration,\" \"connectivity options,\" and \"virtual assistant compatibility\"\\n\\nThe metrics are generally well-defined with appropriate units. The engineering focus is strong for safety and thermal performance, but could be improved by removing marketing metrics and consolidating overlapping measurements.', type='TextMessage'), inner_messages=[])"
