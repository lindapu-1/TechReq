Overall Score: 3.3/5\\n\\n## 2. Breakdown:\\n- Specificity: 4/5\\n- Relevance: 4/5\\n- Non-Redundancy: 2/5\\n\\n## 3. Issues Found:\\n\\n**Specificity Issues:**\\n- \"Material moldability index\" uses a non-standard dimensionless scale (1-10) without defining what each level means\\n- \"Multi-functionality coefficient\" is not clearly defined how it would be measured\\n- \"User satisfaction rating for smart features\" is subjective and not an engineering metric\\n\\n**Relevance Issues:**\\n- IoT Connectivity and App Control categories seem excessive for a mini travel hair dryer, which typically prioritizes simplicity and reliability\\n- \"Number of user-storable personalized profiles\" may not be a priority for a travel device\\n- Missing critical metrics for core functionality like airflow rate (m\u00b3/s) and heating efficiency\\n\\n**Non-Redundancy Issues (significant):**\\n- Substantial overlap between categories:\\n  - \"Safety regulations\" and \"Safety certifications\" contain redundant metrics\\n  - \"Overheat protection\" overlaps with multiple safety categories\\n  - \"Temperature Sensors\" and \"smart temperature control\" measure similar properties\\n  - \"International electrical standards\" overlaps with \"safety standards across international markets\"\\n- Several metrics appear in multiple categories:\\n  - Multiple temperature measurements across different categories\\n  - Multiple certification-related metrics\\n  - Safety compliance appears in several places\\n- \"Coordinate smart technology integration\" contains management KPIs rather than engineering metrics\\n\\nThe metrics would benefit from consolidation into fewer, more distinct categories focusing on core engineering requirements for a travel hair dryer: thermal performance, electrical safety, mechanical durability, portability features, and user interface.', type='TextMessage'), inner_messages=[])"
