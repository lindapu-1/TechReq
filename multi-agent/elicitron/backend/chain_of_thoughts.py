# Impactful: The need has the potential to create a real difference. This need will delight the user.
# Not Obvious: refers to needs or issues that are not immediately apparent or widely recognized by most users. These are typically subtle, specific, or unique to a smaller group and may require deeper analysis or research to identify, as they are not commonly expressed. Think if most users would not be able to identify this need to call it "Not Obvious".
# Efficient: This will have a positive effect on the user experience. It is going to improve the experience with the product, service, or system.
# Implicit: This is not a standard requirement shared by the user. Not a common requirement given to the designers.

# Do analysis with about the need. You must do it STEP BY STEP for each criteria. Start with "Impactful", then "Not Obvious", then "Efficient", then "Implicit".
# You MUST use a list as an output.
# IMPORTANT: You must think very critically and feel FULLY comfortable calling needs obvious, not impractful, not efficient, or explicit. You must be able to justify your decision.
